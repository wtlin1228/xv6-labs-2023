Q1: Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
A1: usertrap

Q2: What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? 
    (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
A2: 7, SYS_exec, which will be mapped to system call `sys_exec` 

Q3: What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
A3: user mode

Q4: Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. 
    Which register corresponds to the variable num?
A4: 800020b6:	00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
    num corresponds to the register a3

Q5: Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; 
    is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? 
    Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? 
    (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
A5: Address isn't mapped in the kernel address space.
    Yes, exception code 13 means "Load page fault".

Q6: What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? 
    What is its process id (pid)?
A6: p->name = "initcode"
    p->pid = 1
