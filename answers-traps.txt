Q: Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, 
   which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: $a2

Q: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? 
   Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A: 
    - f -> `26:	45b1                	li	a1,12` (it's inlined)
    - g -> `14:	250d                	addw	a0,a0,3` (it's inlined)

Q: At what address is the function printf located?
A: 0x630

Q: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A: 0x38

Q: Run the following code. What's the output? 
   ```
   unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
   printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
   ```
A: "HE110 World"

Q: The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. 
   If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to 
   yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
A: 0x726c6400, don't need to change 57616

Q: In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? 
   (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
   ```
   printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
   ```
A: It depends on the `$a2`.
